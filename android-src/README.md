# FART Android Implementation Sources

Android source version is `v6.0.1_r10`.

Reference: http://androidxref.com/6.0.1_r10/

## Annotations

I add some annotations for more readableness.

The all fart codes start with `// fart start` and end with `// fart end`.

And all codes are formated by `clang-format`.
